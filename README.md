# What's the point of this repo?
Honestly, I'm not sure. Everything is oddly specific.

# Okay well what is here at least?
Well, there's:
* a script that can help you be extra lazy when playing bingo, just because
* a script that can help you download and install things without a browser using choco
* a script for people who want to disable boost on their CPU
* a script for Project Diablo 2 updating without the official launcher
   _currently it will just update all files, local check is busted_ (not updated or maintained)
* a script to search specific or general locations recursively for files (because Windows Explorer index searching is often garbage)

# You're an incredible salesman
Thanks, I'm really trying.
